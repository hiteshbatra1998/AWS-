WHAT IS OS ?
It act as itermediatory between computer hardware and its users. The hardware consists of memory, CPU, ALU, and I/O devices, peripheral device, and storage device. 
Purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.
An operating system is a software that manages the computer hardware
An Operating System performs all the basic tasks like managing file,process, and memory. Thus operating system acts as manager of all the resources, i.e. resource manager.
It performs basic tasks such as recognizing input from the keyboard, keeping track of files and directories on the disk, sending output to the display screen and controlling peripheral devices.
controls the execution of application programs
A more common definition is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being application programs
Function of OS -> An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as memory, processors, devices, and information. The operating system correspondingly includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler, memory management module, I/O programs, and a file system.

Goals of Operating system – Operating system performs three functions:
Convenience: An OS makes a computer more convenient to use.
Efficiency: An OS allows the computer system resources to be used in an efficient manner.
Ability to Evolve: An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing and introduction of new system functions at the same time without interfering with service.

Abstract view of System :-
User interact with 3rd party applications installed on os -> Which interact with OS  -> Which interact with computer hardware

The Operating system must support the following tasks. The task are:
Provides the facilities to create, modification of programs and data files using an editor.
Access to the compiler for translating the user program from high level language to machine language.
Provide a loader program to move the compiled program code to the computer’s memory for execution.
Provide routines that handle the details of I/O programming.

Compiler – The language processor that reads the complete source program written in high level language as a whole in one go and translates it into an equivalent program in machine language is called as a Compiler. Ex C, C++ 
Assembler –The Assembler is used to translate the program written in Assembly language into machine code. The source program is a input of assembler that contains assembly language instructions. The output generated by assembler is the object code or machine code understandable by the computer.
Interpreter –The translation of single statement of source program into machine code is done by language processor and executes it immediately before moving on to the next line is called an interpreter. If there is an error in the statement, the interpreter terminates its translating process at that statement and displays an error message. 
             The interpreter moves on to the next line for execution only after removal of the error. An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine code.Example: Perl, Python and Matlab.
             
TYPES OF OS :-
1) Batch os -> Copy
2) Multiprogramming -> Copy ( Not necessary to mention )
3) Time Sharing / Multitasking -> Each task is given some time to execute, so that all the tasks work smoothly. Each user gets time of CPU as they use single system. These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems. 
                                  The task can be from single user or from different users also. The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum. After this time interval is over OS switches over to next task.
                                  Multiprogramming with time sharing.
                                  From Copy too.
                                  eg - UNIX
4) Multiprocesing -> Multiple cpu. Can be symetric and asymetric ( Master Slave ) .
                     Copy
                     An asymmetric multiprocessing system is a multiprocessor computer system where not all of the multiple interconnected central processing units are treated equally. For example, a system might allow only one CPU to execute operating system code or might allow only one CPU to perform I/O operations
                      
5) Distributed OS -> Various autonomous interconnected computers communicate each other using a shared communication network.
                      Independent systems possess their own memory unit and CPU. These are referred as loosely coupled systems or distributed systems. These system’s processors differ in size and function. The major benefit of working with these types of operating system is that it is always possible 
                      that one user can access the files or software which are not actually present on his system but on some other system connected within this network i.e., remote access is enabled within the devices connected in that network.   
                      ADVANTAGE -> Failure of one will not affect the other network communication, as all systems are independent from each other
                                   Electronic mail increases the data exchange speed
                                    Since resources are being shared, computation is highly fast and durable
                                    Load on host computer reduces
                      DISADVANTAGE -> These types of systems are not readily available as they are very expensive
                                       Failure of the main network will stop the entire communication
                      eg - LOCUS OS.
6) *It is architectute * Network / Client Server -> These systems run on a server and provide the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions. These type of operating systems allow shared access of files, printers, security, applications, and other networking functions over a small private network. 
                              One more important aspect of Network Operating Systems is that all the users are well aware of the underlying configuration, of all other users within the network, their individual connections etc. and that’s why these computers are popularly known as tightly coupled systems.
                              Advantages of Network Operating System:
                              Highly stable centralized servers
                              Security concerns are handled through servers
                               New technologies and hardware up-gradation are easily integrated to the system
                               Disadvantages of Network Operating System:
                               Servers are costly
                               User has to depend on central location for most operations
                               Maintenance and updates are required regularly
                               EG Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2008, UNIX, Linux
                              
 7) Real Time OS -> These types of OSs serves the real-time systems. The time interval required to process and respond to inputs is very small. This time interval is called response time.
                    Real-time systems are used when there are time requirements are very strict like missile systems, air traffic control systems, robots etc.
                    Two types of Real-Time Operating System which are as follows:
                    Hard Real-Time Systems:
                        These OSs are meant for the applications where time constraints are very strict and even the shortest possible delay is not acceptable. These systems are built for saving life like automatic parachutes or air bags which are required to be readily available in case of any accident. Virtual memory is almost never found in these systems.
                    Soft Real-Time Systems:
                         These OSs are for applications where for time-constraint is less strict.
                    Advantages of RTOS:
                      Maximum Consumption: Maximum utilization of devices and system,thus more output from all the resources
                      Task Shifting: Time assigned for shifting tasks in these systems are very less. For example in older systems it takes about 10 micro seconds in shifting one task to another and in latest systems it takes 3 micro seconds.
                      Focus on Application: Focus on running applications and less importance to applications which are in queue.
                    Disadvantages of RTOS:
                      Limited Tasks: Very few tasks run at the same time and their concentration is very less on few applications to avoid errors.
                      Use heavy system resources: Sometimes the system resources are not so good and they are expensive as well.
                      Complex Algorithms: The algorithms are very complex and difficult for the designer to write on.
                    Eg used in aircraft , satellite , Scientific experiments , air traffic control systems
 
8) Parallel System , Personal System -> Copy.

Types Of Memory in OS -> There are 4 types of memory - Primary/Main , Secondary , Cache ,Register
                        Main memory (RAM and ROM) and Secondary memory(hard drive,CD,etc.). 
                        Random Access Memory (RAM) is primary-volatile memory and Read Only Memory (ROM) is primary-non-volatile memory.
                        RAM is devided into SRAM and DRAM 
                        ROM is devided into PROM EPROM EEPROM
                        
                        Random Access Memory (RAM) –
                          It is also called as read write memory or the main memory or the primary memory.
                          The programs and data that the CPU requires during execution of a program are stored in this memory.
                          It is a volatile memory as the data loses when the power is turned off.
                        Read Only Memory (ROM) –
                            Stores crucial information essential to operate the system, like the program essential to boot the computer.
                            It is not volatile.
                            Always retains its data.
                            Used in embedded systems or where the programming needs no change.
                            Used in calculators and peripheral devices.
                            
( 1 byte = 8 bit , 1024 byte = 1KB  , 1024 KB = 1 MB , 1024 MB = 1GB , 1GB =  1024 PB petabyte)
 
Difference between 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems
In computing, there exist two type processor i.e., 32-bit and 64-bit. This type of processor tells us how much memory a processor can have access from a CPU register.
A 32-bit system can access 2^32 memory addresses, i.e 4 GB of RAM or physical memory ideally, it can access more than 4 GB of RAM also. The actual limit is often less around 3.5 GB since part of the register is used to store other temporary values besides memory addresses 
A 64-bit system can access 2^64 memory addresses, i.e actually 18-Quintillion bytes of RAM. In short, any amount of memory greater than 4 GB can be easily handled by it.
major difference between 32-bit processors and 64-bit processors is the number of calculations per second they can perform, which affects the speed at which they can complete tasks. 
64-bit processors can come in dual-core, quad-core, six-core, and eight-core versions for home computing. Multiple cores allow for an increased number of calculations per second that can be performed, which can increase the processing power and help make a computer run faster
Cores state the number of process stay at a time in primary/main memory. Dual core - 2 process at a time.
A computer with a 64-bit processor can have a 64-bit or 32-bit version of an operating system installed. However, with a 32-bit operating system, the 64-bit processor would not run at its full capability.  
 
Memory Partition
Continous & Non continous.
Continous -> Copy
Non Contigous -> Paging & Segmentation
Physical address & Logical address -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmTMr_x3NwY
Need of logical/virtual address -> Security - so that user cant access the memory directlty.
